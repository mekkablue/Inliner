# Inliner

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). After installation, it will add the menu item *Filer > Inliner.* You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences. The filter will expand a skeleton path to an inlined stroke:

![Inliner](Inliner.png)

* *Stroke Width* is the complete width of the (double) stroke.
* *Inline Width* is the width of the white gap inside the stroke.

In the number fields, use up and down arrows for adjusting the value by one unit. Hold down Shift for increments of 10 units, Cmd-Shift for increments of 100 units.

### Installation

1. One-click install *Inliner* from *Window > Plugin Manager*
2. Restart Glyphs.
